# Project UR5 with Moveit 2 Simulation

## Description
This project focuses on the simulation and utilization of Moveit 2 for the UR5 robot. It includes a brief analysis conducted in the UR5_IK.ipynb notebook, and the analysis is also available in the PDF file. The folders present in the repository were generated during the loading of the robot in Moveit 2.

## Moveit 2
Moveit 2 is a widely-used ROS (Robot Operating System) framework for motion planning, manipulation, and control of robotic arms. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and APIs that enable developers to easily set up, control, and simulate robotic systems. Moveit 2 includes features such as motion planning algorithms, collision checking, kinematics solvers, and visualization tools, making it a powerful tool for robotic applications.

## UR5
The UR5 (Universal Robots UR5) is a collaborative robotic arm manufactured by Universal Robots. It is widely used in industrial and research settings due to its versatility, ease of use, and safety features. The UR5 is known for its six degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks with precision and flexibility. It is commonly used in applications such as pick-and-place operations, assembly, and machine tending.
